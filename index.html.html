    <h1 style="color: aliceblue">10.Princess Mononoke:</h1>
    <h2 style="color: aliceblue">Genre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy</h2>
    <h2 style="color:aliceblue">Princess Mononoke is a stunning anime film that captivates audiences with its beautiful animation, compelling story, and memorable characters. Set in a mystical and fantastical world, the film follows the journey of Ashitaka, a young warrior who becomes embroiled in a conflict between the human settlers of a mining village and the forest gods of the surrounding wilderness. One of the things that sets Princess Mononoke apart is its attention to detail. The world that director Hayao Miyazaki and his team have created is richly imagined and meticulously crafted, with every frame filled with intricate details and stunning visuals. The characters are similarly well-realized; with each one possessing a distinct personality and backstory that makes them feel like fully realized individuals. Another strength of Princess Mononoke is its storytelling. The film explores themes of environmentalism, industry, and the balance between humans and nature in a way that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. Overall, Princess Mononoke is an anime masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received..</h2>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">Oregairu directed by Ai Yoshimura is a unique rom-com anime series. It is a very deep social commentary interesting anime. The plot revolves around an antisocial high school student who is a loner and has no friends or girlfriend with a distorted view on life. 
    The main protagonist of the series, Hachiman Hikigaya is a very secluded introvert where he really hates everything like friendship, school. He has a very unique way of looking at life and looking at many kinds of social situations especially in his high school as he is currently a high school student. The main part that makes this series interesting and super-clever is not the story so much but more the characters. I love this show for its character development. Also, there are certain aspects of each character that majority of the fanbase relates to, so that’s another reason why this series is so loved.
